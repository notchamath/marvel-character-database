# [Marvel Character Database](https://cozy-frangipane-4683ec.netlify.app/)

<img src="./src/assets/screenshots/home-page.png">

## The Idea
A `Fully Responsive` React App that fetches data from the **The Marvel Comics API**, allowing users to search for or browse through all of Marvel Comic book characters. `Infinite Scroll` feature populates the homepage as a user scrolls down. `React Context` is used to let users sign-in. Once a user is signed-in, the user can save any characters to `Firestore` database backend by clicking the **Like** button. These **Liked** characters will show up on the user's **My Team** page, as long as the user is signed-in. If the user is not signed-in, the **My Team** page will automatically redirect to **Authentication** page because **My Team** is a protected route (**Authentication** page becomes a protected route if the user is already signed-in). `React Router` is used for all routing. `Conditional Redndering` is used throughout the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
